include just enough \n                        context to uniquely identify the text being modified.\n                        \n                        Takes:\n                        - file_path: Path to the file to edit\n                        - old_string: Text to replace\n                        - new_string: Replacement text\n                        - expected_replacements: Optional parameter for number of replacements\n                        \n                        By default, replaces only ONE occurrence of the search text.\n                        To replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with\n                        the exact number of matches expected.\n                        \n                        UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT: When expected_replacements=1 (default), include the minimal\n                        amount of context necessary (typically 1-3 lines) before and after the change point,\n                        with exact whitespace and indentation.\n                        \n                        When editing multiple sections, make separate edit_block calls for each distinct change\n                        rather than one large replacement.\n                        \n                        When a close but non-exact match is found, a character-level diff is shown in the format:\n                        common_prefix{-removed-}{+added+}common_suffix to help you identify what's different.\n                        \n                        Similar to write_file, there is a configurable line limit (fileWriteLineLimit) that warns\n                        if the edited file exceeds this limit., force_terminate -\u003e \n                        Force terminate a running terminal session.\n                        \n   ..., get_config -\u003e Get the complete server configuration as JSON., get_file_info -\u003e Retrieve detailed metadata about a file or directory including:\n                        - size\n                        - creation time\n                        - last modified time \n                        - permissions\n                        - type\n                        - lineCount (for text files)\n                        -

use processes for ALL file-based work.\n                        \n                        FILE ANALYSIS PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY):\n                        1., kill_process -\u003e \n                        Terminate a running process by PID.\n                        \n           ..., list_directory -\u003e Get a detailed listing of all files and directories in a specified path.\n                        \n                        Use this instead of 'execute_command' with ls/dir commands.\n                        Results distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes.\n                        \n                        Supports recursive listing with the 'depth' parameter (default: 2):\n                        - depth=1: Only direct contents of the directory\n                        - depth=2: Contents plus one level of subdirectories\n                        - depth=3+: Multiple levels deep\n                        \n                        CONTEXT OVERFLOW PROTECTION:\n                        - Top-level directory shows ALL items\n                        - Nested directories are limited to 100 items maximum per directory\n                        - When a nested directory has more than 100 items, you'll see a warning like:\n                          [WARNING] node_modules: 500 items hidden (showing first 100 of 600 total)\n                        - This prevents overwhelming the context with large directories like node_modules\n                        \n                        Results show full relative paths from the root directory being listed.\n                        Example output with depth=2:\n                        [DIR] src\n                        [FILE] src/index.ts\n                        [DIR] src/tools\n                        [FILE] src/tools/filesystem.ts\n                        \n                        If a directory cannot be accessed, it will show [DENIED] instead.\n                        Only works within allowed directories.\n                        \n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability., list_processes -\u003e \n                        List all running processes.\n                        \n                   ..., list_searches -\u003e List all active searches.\n                        \n                        Shows search IDs, search types, patterns, status, and runtime.\n                        Similar to list_sessions for terminal processes., list_sessions -\u003e \n                        List all active terminal sessions.\n                        \n            ..., move_file -\u003e Move or rename files and directories.\n                        \n                        Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation.\n                        Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n                        \n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability., read_file -\u003e Read the contents of a file from the file system or a URL with optional offset and length parameters.\n                        \n                        Prefer this over 'execute_command' with cat/type for viewing files.\n                        \n                        Supports partial file reading with:\n                        - 'offset' (start line, default: 0)\n                          * Positive: Start from line N (0-based indexing)\n                          * Negative: Read last N lines from end (tail behavior)\n                        - 'length' (max lines to read, default: configurable via 'fileReadLineLimit' setting, initially 1000)\n                          * Used with positive offsets for range reading\n                          * Ignored when offset is negative (reads all requested tail lines)\n                        \n                        Examples:\n                        - offset: 0, length: 10     → First 10 lines\n                        - offset: 100, length: 5    → Lines 100-104\n                        - offset: -20               → Last 20 lines  \n                        - offset: -5, length: 10    → Last 5 lines (length ignored)\n                        \n                        Performance optimizations:\n                        - Large files with negative offsets use reverse reading for efficiency\n                        - Large files with deep positive offsets use byte estimation\n                        - Small files use fast readline streaming\n                        \n                        When reading from the file system, only works within allowed directories.\n                        Can fetch content from URLs when isUrl parameter is set to true\n                        (URLs are always read in full regardless of offset/length).\n                        \n                        Handles text files normally and image files are returned as viewable images.\n                        Recognized image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP.\n                        \n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability., read_multiple_files -\u003e Read the contents of multiple files simultaneously.\n                        \n                        Each file's content is returned with its path as a reference.\n                        Handles text files normally and renders images as viewable content.\n                        Recognized image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP.\n                        \n                        Failed reads for individual files won't stop the entire operation.\n                        Only works within allowed directories.\n                        \n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability., read_process_output -\u003e \n                        Read output from a running process with intelligent completion detection..., set_config_value -\u003e \n                        Set a specific configuration value by key.\n                        \n    ..., start_process -\u003e Start a new terminal process with intelligent state detection.\n                        \n                        PRIMARY TOOL FOR FILE ANALYSIS AND DATA PROCESSING\n                        This is the ONLY correct tool for analyzing local files (CSV, JSON, logs, etc.).\n                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL -
