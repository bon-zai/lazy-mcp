Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.\n                        This command can be referenced as \"DC: ...\" or \"use Desktop Commander to ...\" in your instructions.",
