ALWAYS FIRST: Use this tool (start_process + interact_with_process) for local data analysis\n                        2. ALTERNATIVE: Use command-line tools (cut, awk, grep) for quick processing  \n                        3. NEVER EVER: Use analysis tool for local file access (IT WILL FAIL)\n                        \n                        REQUIRED INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW FOR FILE ANALYSIS:\n                        1. Start REPL: start_process(\"python3 -i\")\n                        2. Load libraries: interact_with_process(pid, \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np\")\n                        3. Read file: interact_with_process(pid, \"df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')\")\n                        4. Analyze: interact_with_process(pid, \"print(df.describe())\")\n                        5.
