Default shell: powershell.exe.\n        \nWINDOWS-SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING:\n- If Node.js/Python commands fail with \"not recognized\" errors:\n  * Try different shells: specify shell parameter as \"cmd\" or \"powershell.exe\"\n  * PowerShell may have execution policy restrictions for some tools\n  * CMD typically has better compatibility with development tools\n  * Use set_config_value to change defaultShell if needed\n- Windows services and processes use different commands (Get-Process vs ps)\n- Package managers: choco, winget, scoop instead of apt/brew\n- Environment variables: $env:VAR instead of $VAR\n- File permissions work differently than Unix systems\n                        \n                        REQUIRED WORKFLOW FOR LOCAL FILES:\n                        1. start_process(\"python3 -i\") - Start Python REPL for data analysis\n                        2. interact_with_process(pid, \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np\")\n                        3. interact_with_process(pid, \"df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')\")\n                        4. interact_with_process(pid, \"print(df.describe())\")\n                        5. Continue analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.\n                        \n                        COMMON FILE ANALYSIS PATTERNS:\n                        • start_process(\"python3 -i\") → Python REPL for data analysis (RECOMMENDED)\n                        • start_process(\"node -i\") → Node.js for JSON processing  \n                        • start_process(\"cut -d',' -f1 file.csv | sort | uniq -c\") → Quick CSV analysis\n                        • start_process(\"wc -l /path/file.csv\") → Line counting\n                        • start_process(\"head -10 /path/file.csv\") → File preview\n                        \n                        BINARY FILE SUPPORT:\n                        For PDF, Excel, Word, archives, databases, and other binary formats, use process tools with appropriate libraries or command-line utilities.\n                        \n                        INTERACTIVE PROCESSES FOR DATA ANALYSIS:\n                        1. start_process(\"python3 -i\") - Start Python REPL for data work\n                        2. start_process(\"node -i\") - Start Node.js REPL for JSON/JS\n                        3. start_process(\"bash\") - Start interactive bash shell\n                        4. Use interact_with_process() to send commands\n                        5. Use read_process_output() to get responses\n                        \n                        SMART DETECTION:\n                        - Detects REPL prompts (\u003e\u003e\u003e, \u003e, $, etc.)\n                        - Identifies when process is waiting for input\n                        - Recognizes process completion vs timeout\n                        - Early exit prevents unnecessary waiting\n                        \n                        STATES DETECTED:\n                        Process waiting for input (shows prompt)\n                        Process finished execution\n                        Process running (use read_process_output)\n\n                        PERFORMANCE DEBUGGING (verbose_timing parameter):\n                        Set verbose_timing: true to get detailed timing information including:\n                        - Exit reason (early_exit_quick_pattern, early_exit_periodic_check, process_exit, timeout)\n                        - Total duration and time to first output\n                        - Complete timeline of all output events with timestamps\n                        - Which detection mechanism triggered early exit\n                        Use this to identify missed optimization opportunities and improve detection patterns.\n\n                        ALWAYS USE FOR: Local file analysis, CSV processing, data exploration, system commands\n                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (analysis tool is browser-only and WILL FAIL)\n\n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.\n                        This command can be referenced as \"DC: ...\" or \"use Desktop Commander to ...\" in your instructions.",
