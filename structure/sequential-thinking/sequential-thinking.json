  "overview": "sequential-thinking: 1 tools; sequentialthinking -\u003e A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Repeats the process until satisfied\n- Provides a correct answer\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n\nYou should:\n1."
